        The 12th century church was demolished and replaced once again in the early 16th century. Construction began in 1505 to designs of the architect Cristoforo da Legname,[2] but by the middle of the century the building remained incomplete. In 1552 the church's procurator Tommaso Rangone commissioned the architect Jacopo Sansovino to design a façade for the building, which was to include a statue of himself. The Senate denied this proposal, but a statue of Rangone was later featured on the façade of the nearby church of San Zulian.[3] After Sansovino finalised the church's design, works resumed and the building was completed in 1557. Sansovino was buried within the church after his death in 1570, and his children Fiorenza and Francesco were later also buried with him.

        A library, which may vary widely in size, may be organized for use and maintained by a public body such as a government; an institution such as a school or museum; a corporation; or a private individual. In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are trained and experts at finding, selecting, circulating and organizing information and at interpreting information needs, navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of resources.

    <p> Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.</p>

  <p> A science project is an educational activity for students involving experiments or construction of models in one of the science disciplines. Students may present their science project at a science fair, so they may also call it a science fair project. Science projects may be classified into four main types.</p>
